## CVE-Info.py
### Overview
This simple program intends to provide users with additional metrics regarding a set of CVE IDs.

The purpose of this code is to add EPSS and Known Exploited Vulnerability data to a list of CVEs.  Users can choose how to input files, such as CSV or Terminal. 
### Details
#### User Input
The program requests the user to specify how they want to provide a set of CVEs for review.  The user can directly input them into the terminal or specify a file path.

Based on the input method, the program creates a list of KEVs to use in the other methods and calls.
#### CISA KEV
CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerability Catalog is a valuable tool when prioritizing which CVEs to remediate.

The program downloads the most up-to-date version of the KEV Catalog and provides additional details to the end user, including:
- "is_kev" - this is a true/false field.  This field is set to TRUE if a provided CVE is found in the Catalog.
- "knownRansomwareCampaignUse" - will either be "Known" or "N/A" depending on the information provided in the Catalog.
#### EPSS
The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is another valuable tool for determining the priority of remediating CVEs.  The EPSS model predicts the likelihood that a particular CVE will be exploited.

The program calls the EPSS API to determine the EPSS score and appends it to the CVE information.
#### Data Formatting
The program uses the Pandas library to transform the CVE data into a concise and readable Excel format.
