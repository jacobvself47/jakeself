My goal is to install, test, and run a Trivy-Operator.

The first step in this process is to create a vulnerable Kubernetes cluster for testing.

- Install Minikube on your local machine
- Install a vulnerable web app
    - I used the Trivy-Demo Web App: https://github.com/AnaisUrlichs/trivy-demo/tree/main/manifests
